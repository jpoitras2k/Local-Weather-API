# Local-Weather-API

This Local Weather app was a project idea from FreeCodeCamp.  I used codepen.io to write the program.
One of the first problems encountered was that the location wasnt that accurate.
So, I decided to go with the City code instead of GPS location to get the local weather.

Tell me what you think.
